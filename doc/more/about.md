# About Phpillip

Hi, I'm [Thomas Jarrand](https://github.com/tom32i).
I'm a web developer using Symfony a lot, I created and maintain Phpillip.

I first built it as a tool to create my [technical blog](http://thomas.jarrand.fr/blog/).

It's not meant to be the best PHP Website Generator around: its first goal was to fit my needs.

However I documented and open-sourced it and will be happy if it helps any of you to build your projects.

Open-source rocks,

Thomas.
